              <div class="text"><b>A view of human society and nature through my perceivedness</b><br><br>Time passes gradually. Sometimes slow and at other times fast, but the most of it to our unawareness. Many people will come in your life and go, some having relationships of short durations whereas others short and fragile. But whatever be your kinship with them, never let them climb up to your head, for these are of transient existence, if not of extremely deep connexion of sacred and heavenly nature, which in only trace amounts can be found, and moreover owing to the humanly demeanour, the much of it can be correlated by anyone.<br>If thought deeply about the topic, much consciousness can be drawn. But according to my opinion, much of the human interference is of no significance and gradually disintegrates with time but the laws of nature and your understanding of them remains for eternity and though these are timeless, as they possess no conscious mind, or is it? But everything you see in the universe are bound to obey them.<br>Although you may not be much unconstrained to think about the world and nature because of the same human interferences, but you can of course try hard to reveal the mysteries the mysteries of the universe and try to open the doors of knowledge, for knowledge surpasses everything in this universe of ours. It is true that this goal of ours to move forward on the path of time and wisdom is not easy and challenges have to be always overcome, yet let us never ever lose hope and keep moving forward in search of a better future.<br>There are certainly many things which are not much peaceful and soothing int the present but always remember one thing, "In this universe time is extremely powerful". Nothing materialistic will remain for time unfathomable. Hence, better situation will surely come but try to take advantage of them. Be aware of the preciousness of time, be strong, be aware and "KEEP MOVING FORWARD".</div>

              <div class="text"><b>Prototypical experience accrued after shifting to some new place: My view and sentiments</b>
              <br><br>Adaptation is an way of life. It is actually an art which some of us are proficient at from the root whereas others take considerable time to manoeuvre and grind this art-form. Evasion from it is simply not an alternative! And still if done, only to add to the deleteriousness of thet being!
              <br>Friends and foes can be perceived to be indeed the same in such a situation, much to them who have a somewhat wispy discernment of their surroundings. But in such a case, trenchant intercation with benign individuals can do much of the trick for progressive survival.
              <br>You should be by any means sufficiently competent to achieve your dreams by hard-work, dedication, allegiance or by any legal means by making use of all the facilities and human-resources you are getting, and try to hone your skills and expertise in any subject matter which you may be pursuing, for these individuals or so called 'Friends' might not pay heed to you once they would have accomplished their desire or destination, but your skills would remain by your side and always support you, no matter in what situation you might be presiding right then.
              <br>In such a transitional circumstance, you however might trace the emotion of non-existence and inconspicuousness, but don't be concerned about that, for of their ephemeral existence. Always try to give your best in your activities and keep moving forward, never remain static. No one will do your work, no one will care for you like your parents or care whether your health is good or not! Most importantly always try to remain optimistic and never ever lose your focus. Also, whenever you may be feeling a little distracted, try to retrieve your consciousness about why you are there, what is your target wherever you might be! Always feel unafraid of expressing yourself and keep saying to yourself, 'I am the greatest'.</div>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
              Django is a very popular framework when one wants to integrate the functionalities of python and web development. Django can also be used to build websites and blogs in a relatively small period of time, without having to write the entire code from scratch. It is such a powerful framework that it already provides the basic implementation files for developing your website. With python framework behind it, it can also be used for machine learning and for applying many algorithms on the content present upon the website. Django is a simple framework, with a database called "dB SQLite" automatically stored in it for its users. It is user-friendly. It supports basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building responsive web applications. It is easy to use and also it is built in python that's why it is most suitable for python lovers out there. This framework is for large and advanced web applications. At the same time here, some might say that many articles came up and said that flask is a better and easier framework to use if going for a machine learning based web application. Well, flask might be a better replacement for Django, but the developer friendly environment and also after looking at the rising popularity of Django, I will say the opposite. Django can help you  develop quite large web applications opening up a lot of opportunities for future.<br><br><b>Published: 13 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
                Blockchain is a record of all the transactions involving cryptocurrency in a well-defined form of ledgers. As the name suggests, it is a kind of chain which is very difficult to tamper, modify and hack, making it extremely reliable and fault-tolerant. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand are digital currencies which unlike traditional currencies are not centralized. Their trade is possible in a decentralized manner, which means there is no third-party or government interference over who you can lend or receive cryptos from. There are many kinds of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Dogecoin, Polygon, etc. Among all these coins, Bitcoin is the most popular and widely known cryptocurrency. It is so famous and accceptable, that all the other coins are known as shitcoins. One can trade in cryptocurrencies in many forms. You can use either online or software, hardware or paper trading platforms. One way is to open exodus.com and download the desktop or android version of it, and get started with it. As simple as it seems to be, it is not so. There are multiple ways of doing it and often one needs to do proper research from trusted sites to get accustomed to all these businesses. Even while doing trading and sending cryptos in transactions, one has to be very carefull in terms of the encryption techniques and cross-verify whether his or her private-key is getting leaked or not. Apart from all these, there are a number of other factors too which one might consider to become a successful trader, and should keep himself updated about the market fluctuations. It is a very different game and one needs to invest carefully.<br><br><b>Published: 06 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
                Why are we all here? what is our purpose in life? What are we supposed to do once we are born and what are the principles of life? Is there any book on guidelines of living a perfect life? These are some among the numerous questions which had been asked by philosophers and other spiritual persons from time immemorial.<br>But have we ever wondered about the basic thing which remains hidden in these questions ourselves? If we think about it deeply, I believe we would come down to the fundamental propencity of enquiring who is god and what is our relationship with him?<br>Did god created us or we are just a result of evolution of life on planet earth over billions of years? If we assume that god created us, what can be the purpose behind it... If he is so powerful then why would he need us to worship him, pray to him, etc. He is perhaps self-sufficient, a self-subsisting being, both formidable and respledent. I once believed that he created us in the lower domain, because he is all alone in the non-materialistic spiritual upper-domain, and aims to teach us life lessons by providing encumbrances in our path, so that we become like him so that he can share his feelings with us. Thats why he is also referred to as the great teacher in ancient scriptures.<br>What are your takes on this? Do try to contemplate in your free time!<br><br><b>Published: 05 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

                What can be more refreshing and enjoying than a visit to a mall with your friends after a difficult and hectic exam schedule spanning an entire week? Well, it seems that there are unlikely many general choices other than this for the normies and extrovert people out there. I visited a mall today, not because I had a hectic week of exams, but because I was completely punctured by boredom by sitting on my couch in my home. I must say that a visit to City Center, Rajarhat, Kolkata, was one hell of a refreshing experience for me after a millenium...<br>
                But what made this experience wholesome and utterly enjoyable? It seems most of us might answer it with something like the ambience, mouth-watering dishes in restaurants, 4D cinema theatres, gaming centres, etc. But what makes all these things possible in a smooth and effortless manner? It is the technology which keeps all the things going. With tons of new faces advancing into the malls, there's a need for efficient car parking systems, strict supervision through CCTV cameras, automated robots catering to our food orders, high tech gaming zones with VR and AR, and a multitude of shops and kiosks here and there catering to a wide array of services like jewellery, clothing, cutlery, furnishing, healthcare, and a lot more makes the experience of visiting a mall overwhelming!<br>Computer Science has a big role to play in all these. By making use of databases, recommender systems, back-end and front-end services, automation, cyber spaces, virtual reality, etc., I believe we can enrich the lives of people and lead to an overall amazing experience which makes all these services worth experiencing.<br><br><b>Published: 04 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
                Why I prefer C++ programming language? Well this is the question which I even ask myself, as I too am not fully sure why I like it more than anything else... Well, one probable and highly convincing answer to all of you would be that since the time I came to know about programming, what was programming, what are its uses, etc., I had the knowledge of only one programming language C. I was so much without knowledge that, I even didn't knew that C++ was the incremented version of C, which is considered to be the parent language of all programming languages.<br>When I was in my 8th or 9th grade, we had a subject of Information Technology in our school, but there they taught only the hardware peripherals and socket connections, network topology, HTML, or mostly the services offered by Microsoft like MS-word, MS-powerpoint, MS-access, etc to name a few. Hence, I thought that the subjects related to IT were majorly centred around these basic things only. Little did I knew what was the underlying phenomena which made all these services possible...<br>In my 11th grade, I seriously started to learn C++ programming, as I had it as a major subject at that time. It was during that time only that I gained interest in problem solving and learnt all the basic programming concepts like variables, datatypes, loops, functions, structures, classes, inheritance, file handling, etc. Till date no other programming language has replaced C++ in my favourites list.<br><br><b>Published: 03 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
                After the previous ban of the PUBG (Player Unknown's Battle Grounds) game by Tencent, as it was found to secretely communicate with Chinese servers, and sending the private data of the Indian players, the new Beta-release of the BGMI (Battle Grounds Mobile India) by KRAFTON had made the old gamers to go crazy over its release. But, what is the full proof guarantee that the new temporary release of BGMI in playstore also not safe? In a recent video which I saw, one of the users of BGMI, in an attempt to investigate the safeness of the app, was giving the live demonstration of playing the game besides listing the name of the servers with which the app communicates while in use, by sniffing internet traffic.<br>The results showed that, although many servers were located in Singapore and USA, some were also located in China by using <a href="https://www.whois.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: silver;"><b>whois.com</b></a> for finding the informations pertaining to those domains. Some of the server domain names, which were located in China and were caught during the live play were, <b style="color: silver;">idcconfig.gcloudsdk.com</b> and <b style="color: silver;">down.anticheatexpert.com</b> and they were communicating with Chinese servers and sending and receiving information from there. Hence, we should refrain from playing such games if we really value our privacy and want our private data to not get exploited!<br><br><b>Published: 02 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

In this client-server architecture, the client can access large geographical data of parts of the globe, located in a remote server by making use of an URL (Uniform Resource Locater), without having to access those informations by creating custom applications. The client can be a web server, mobile application and desktop application.<br>
                The Web GIS technology allows organizations to effectively manage their geographic data, and also it provides a platform for integrating GIS with other business systems and enables cross-organizational collaboration. Earlier to answer a set of questions based on such data, the data had to be throughly analyzed and then a possible answer had to be framed, but with the emergence of this technology, now the data is transformed into web maps or services that are mashed up with different layers into a webGIS, which provides the possibility to answer any sort of questions.<br><br><b>Published: 01 / 07 / 2021</b></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #ffdefd; font-family: arial;">
                Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.<br>
                There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common use is to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch computers or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the ability to run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation, keeping programs running inside of a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual machine on the same host.<br><br><b>Published: 30 / 06 / 2021</b></p>

                This is the start of my blog. Here, in this website, I shall discuss about coding principles, programming paradigms, different programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc. I will also be talking about the very basic and principle languages used for Web Dev like HTML5 (Hyper text Markup Language 5), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), PHP, Javascript, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), etc. and also some other frameworks such as Nodejs, MongoDB, Reactjs, ReactNative, Vuejs, Vanilla js, and what not. Being a computer science student, I like to keep myself updated with the recent developments in the world of programming and development. It is one of the integral reasons why I started this website so that my knowledge base might help those who are in need of these kinds of information. I will also be discussing about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Large Scale Data Processing, etc. I am an avid reader of Sci-Fi stuffs and also love to watch movies related to the same. Hence, yes, you all guessed it right! I will also write articles on them in the Blog section of my website. Finally, as already discussed, I am a very philanthropic and philosophical kind of person, who loves to think of new possibilities which can be unfolded in the world by innovative ideas and the right people having like mindset to implement those ideas into practicality. Thus I would like to cover these domains of content writing as well.<br><br><b>Published: 30 / 06 / 2021</b></p>
