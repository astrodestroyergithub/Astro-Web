# Astro-Web

This is my official and very first static website. In this website I shall discuss one and everything about my coding journey and how I came into this domain. Here, I shall try to update you all about the latest tech developments and enhancements in the world of computer science. As you all know that AstroDestroyer146 is all about exploration and setting your mind free in this vast world of knowledge and possibilities... Keeping that point in mind I will endeavor to search for new informations and put them up on my website. I am also a very philosophical and pilanthropic kind of personality, whose heart yearns for the needy and destitute, so in order to express my concerns for them and also to minimise it I also vow to post regularly on those issues. Do check the website completely in your free time and reach me via my social media handles.
