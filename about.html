           <p>Hi there! I am presently an undergrad from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai Campus and I am pursuing my B-Tech  in Computer Science and Engineering. I always had a keen interest in computers and the logical and cognitive way in how they systematically pull things out, giving us humans the fruit of their repetitive and rigorous work. I want to apply my full-fledged knowledge of computer science to the Indian technical institutions involving sophisticated machinery and cutting-edge technology, and take India forward in the technological race.
           <p>I am a computer science geek and love reading books related to the latest technologies coming in town. I like to read as well as watch fictional and sci-fi stuffs and in my leisure time I prefer to indulge myself in thinking about the enormous possibilities which can be unfolded in our world and beyond, by making accurate and technical use of the present and futuristic knowledge of technology, especially in the field of computer science.</p>
           <p>I am a voracious reader of newspapers, and always like to keep myself updated with the current world trends. I enjoy learning new skills, and to improve myself day by day. I know how to do Web Development, by making use of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MongoDB, Node.js, Django, Bootstrap, etc. I am also very proficient in some of the extremely popular and widely recognized programming languages like Java, C, C++ and Python. I had worked with many python libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, tkinter, etc. and had developed some primitive programs with their use. Its also worth mentioning here, from this point of view that I also have laid a very amateur hands on knowledge and learning about Android App Development by using Android Studio. I also have a thorough understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, as far as the concepts which had been taught to me and which I came to know about from my curiosity.</p>
           <p>I am also a YouTuber, and have a channel named AstroDestroyer146. Here, I post occasional videos about technology and computer science, especially related to network security and cryptography. I am also very vigilant about the changes happening around me in the technical domain, and always keep an open-eye on them, and try to make informative and descriptive videos on them as well, whenever I get time from my busy schedule. I'm still a new and inexperienced YouTuber, but I am learning from mistakes and trying to improve each day. I also like to produce content, and am a content-creator as well.</p>
